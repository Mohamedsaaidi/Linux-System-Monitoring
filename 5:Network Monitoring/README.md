3:Connection status and listening ports
# Commands and tools:
# ifconfig/ip: 
Checks network interfaces and IP addresses.

# ping:
Tests connectivity to other systems.

# netstat/ss:
Lists open ports and connections.
ex: ss -tuln

# iftop:

High bandwidth usage on specific interfaces

Packet loss or high latency in pings could signal network issues.
