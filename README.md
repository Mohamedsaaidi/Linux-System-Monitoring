Monitoring a Linux server refers to the process of tracking and analyzing the performance, behavior, and health of a Linux-based system, including its hardware, software, and network components. The goal of monitoring is to ensure the system operates efficiently, reliably, and securely, and to detect and respond to potential issues before they impact users or services.
